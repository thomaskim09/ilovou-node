# ilovou-node: Backend APIs for Vouchy

Welcome to the ilovou-node repository! ilovou-node provides backend APIs facilitating seamless communication between Vouchy and the database.

## About

ilovou-node serves as the backbone of the Vouchy platform, handling communication between the frontend interfaces and the database. Built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database system, ilovou-node ensures smooth data flow and efficient processing of requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** ilovou-node is built on the Node.js runtime environment, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture for handling concurrent requests.
- **Express.js:** Express.js is used as the web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of robust APIs with its minimalist, unopinionated design.
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is employed as the database system, offering flexibility and scalability for storing and managing data in a document-oriented format.

## Features

- **RESTful APIs:** Provide a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs for interacting with the Vouchy platform, including user authentication, voucher management, menu creation, and order processing.
- **Data Validation:** Implement robust data validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully to provide informative responses and maintain a smooth user experience.
- **Security:** Implement security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Project Status

ilovou-node is now complete, providing backend APIs to facilitate seamless communication between Vouchy and the database.
